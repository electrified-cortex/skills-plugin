# Tokens:
#   changed    — file mtime changed; act on it
#   heartbeat  — -Heartbeat window elapsed with no change (proves watcher is alive)

# Exit code: 0 on clean timeout or normal termination; 1 on argument error; 2 on watch failure.

Usage: watch.ps1 <file-path> [-Single] [-Prefix <s>] [-Timeout <s>] [-Debounce <s>] [-Heartbeat <s>] [-Help]

Watches a single file for modification and emits one `changed` per settled burst.

Arguments:
  <file-path>        Absolute path to the file to watch (required, positional).

Options:
  -Single            Exit after the first `changed` (debounce-respecting). Combined with
                     -Timeout, whichever fires first ends the script. Exit code: 0.
  -Prefix <string>   Insert "<prefix>: " between the timestamp and the token on every
                     emitted line. Default empty (no prefix).
  -Timeout <s>       Exit after <s> consecutive idle seconds. Prints "timeout" then exits 0. Default: 0 (disabled).
  -Debounce <s>      Coalescing window: rapid-fire changes collapse into one `changed` after
                     <s> seconds of quiet. Range 0-60. Default: 2.
  -Heartbeat <s>     Emit "heartbeat" every <s> idle seconds. Default: 0 (disabled).
  -Help              Print this help and exit.

Off-ramp:
  Delete the watched file while the script is running → emits `gone` and exits 0.
  Use this as a clean shutdown signal.

Output (one line per event on stdout). Format:
  <ISO8601-UTC-timestamp> [<prefix>: ]<token>
e.g. `2026-05-15T05:48:32Z changed` or `2026-05-15T05:48:32Z Inbox: changed`.

Tokens:
  changed        File mtime changed.
  heartbeat      No change in the last -Heartbeat seconds.
  timeout        -Timeout elapsed with no change; script exits 0.
  gone           Watched file deleted while running; script exits 0.
  missing        Watched file did not exist at start; script exits 0.

Notes:
- File-event-driven via System.IO.FileSystemWatcher (Windows native). Zero idle CPU.
- Watches one file. Spawn N processes for N files.
- Filters atime/chmod via NotifyFilter = LastWriteTime + FileName + Size.
- Atomic temp+rename saves are caught via the Created/Renamed events in addition to Changed.
- Internal: uses Register-ObjectEvent + Wait-Event (WaitForChanged drops events in some pwsh runtimes).
